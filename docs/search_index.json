Multiple types of genomic, epigenomic, and genome variation data were integrated with these locations in order to let researchers quickly generate hypotheses about novel activities of p53 or validate known behaviors. 2.1 Web access The p53motif Database can be accessed via a docker-deployed Shiny App at https://p53motifdb.its.albany.edu/ 2.2 Access to raw data We maintain a Zenodo site containing all raw data tables, a downloadable Shiny app (usable via R, RStudio, or via Dockerfile), and a sqlite database version for advanced queries. 2.3 Feedback Please let us know if you have any questions, comments, or would like additional datasets included in the next version of the p53motifDB by contacting masammons(at)albany.edu 2.4 General Use Figure 2.1: Layout of the p53motifDB Shiny App The p53motifDB web app contains 4 components: the main data table (Chapter 3), the filtering panel (Chapter 4), the data table export section (Chapter 5), and the dataset query section (Chapter 6). These 4 components are used together to explore, filter, and export underlying data from the p53motifDB. Each component will be described in subsequent Chapters of this tutorial to help users navigate the web app and get the most out of the underlying data.

The first column contains the genomic coordinate (‘unique_id’), and other categorical and quantitative data describing the fundamental characteristics of the p53 motif can be found in other columns. Figure 3.1 shows the 7 main navigation features for the Main Data Table, each of which will be discussed in the following sections. Figure 3.1: Navigating the Main Data Table 3.1 Changing the number of displayed rows. Users can select the number of rows they would like displayed on screen. By default, 10 rows are displayed, but users can select 25, 50, or 100 rows. 3.2 Filter table by search term. Users can enter text to filter rows that are displayed based on terms found anywhere within the table. Text search is case-insensitive and partial strings are matched. The number of rows that contain your search term are displayed in the bottom left corner of the Data Table, as shown in 3.4 Figure 3.2: Using the Search box in the Main Data Table 3.3 Column sorting Columns can be sorted in a descending or ascending fashion by clicking/selecting the grey arrow icons next the name of each column. The shading of the up and down arrows denote whether a column is currently unsorted, sorted in ascending fashion, or in a descending fashion. Categorical data columns can be sorted alphabetically from A-Z. Figure 3.3: Using and interpreting the sorting arrows 3.4 Hyperlinks Some values within the data table exist as hyperlinks, which will take users to specific external data sources (such as the ENSEMBL or UCSC databases for genes/transcripts). 3.5 Horizontal Scrolling Not all data can be displayed on the screen at one time, so a horizontal scroll bar allows users to visualize other columns. The number of columns displayed at one time is ultimately determined by the resolution of the users screen and the current zoom level in their web browser. 3.6 Row Display Characteristics The number of rows/p53 motifs currently being displayed and the total number of rows using the current filtering methods (based on Basic Filtering) can be found in the lower left corner of the data table as shown in Figure 3.1. Basic Filtering Methods will be discussed in Chapter 4. An example of how this information is displayed can be found in Figure 3.4. When the Search Box is used, the display changes to show the number of rows being displayed out of the total number of rows that match your Search Term (Figure 3.4B). The Total number of rows/entries that meet your Basic Filtering criteria are also shown. Figure 3.4: How to interpret the Row Display when using the Search Box 3.7 Page Navigation Selectors The number of rows that can be displayed often will be smaller that the number of rows that match the Filtering and Search criteria. Thus, users can cycle through the page being displayed using a standard “Previous” and “Next” navigation system. Because the number pages displayed in the Main Data Table window can be quite high, we find it easier to filter your data further (either using the Search Box or Basic Filtering) than to try to find data by clicking through to different pages.

Users may want to perform exploratory data analysis to generate novel hypotheses or they may have a specific question they’d like to answer, such as whether there is a p53 binding event near their favorite gene. Both of these scenarios can investigated using a series of Data Filters found on the left-hand side of the website/app. These Data Filters are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, but are purposefully not comprehensive. Not all data types (columns) can be filtered using the provided tools. We tried to make the filtering tools intuitive so that all users could jump in quickly and start to explore the dataset. To faciliate this, we chose not to include advanced data filters or filters for all of the categorical and quantitative information in the data table. We strongly recommend using the provided filters for simple filtering operations and for intial hypothesis generation. Advanced filtering and analysis can be performed on the exported datasets (see Chapters 5 and 6). To facilitate this, the entire Main Data Table and all accessory data tables can be downloaded from Zenodo for input into any data analysis platform (such as R). Users who are familiar with traditional database queries can also find a pre-compiled sqlite database at Zenodo. In the following sections, we will walkthrough the 5 categories of data filters, how to use them, and our recommendations for filtering. 4.1 Basic Filters First, let’s discuss 4 basic data filters for position of the p53RE within the genome and its location relative to genes. 4.1.1 Gene Symbol/HGNC Filtering The top box (shown in Figure 4.1A allows users to input a Gene Symbol (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee ID) and filter the Data Table based on whether a p53motif (row) contains that gene information. The input is case-insensitive. For example, typing in “CDKN1A” and “cdkn1a” will yield the same set of filtered data (5 rows)(shown in the dashed box of Figure 4.1A. Partial strings are also matched, so typing “CDKN1” will bring up results containing CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C. The HGNC Filter in the left panel (Figure 4.1A ) and the Search Box in the upper-right hand side of the Main Data Table Window (shown in Figure 4.1B ) can both be used to search for HGNC/Gene Symbol information, but there are key differences between the two filtering approaches. They are not identical. Most important is that the HGNC-specific filter is run first and will reduce the number of rows displayed in the Main Data table in combination with all other Data filters (described in subsequent sections). The Search box would then filter any results in the Main Data table further. As an example, we will discuss the behavior of the HGNC filter and the Main Data Table Search feature if the search terms CDKN1A and PANDAR are used in Figures Figure @ref{fig:hgncsearch}A and B . These are both known p53 target genes with nearby p53RE, so users may want to filter their data to find p53RE near both CDKN1A and PANDAR. Typing CDKN1A into either the HGNC Filter box or the Search box will yield the same number of results (5 rows from the original 412,586, assuming no other filters are used). When the HGNC Filter is used to search for CDKN1A, the Row Display in the Main Data Table will say “Showing 1 to 5 of 5 entries” (Figure 4.1A, dashed box). If the Search Box is used, the display will depict “Showing 1 to 5 of 5 entries (filtered from 412,586 total entries)”. This tells users that there are 412,586 rows that match the filters selected using the Data Filter panel (left-hand side), and that the term input into the Search Box has filtered the dataset to just 5 rows (Figure 4.1 B, dashed box). Figure 4.1: Data Filters versus the Search Box If we input CDKN1A into the HGNC Filter and then further refine our query using the Search Box for “PANDAR”, we see that there are two rows that match these criteria out of 5 total entries. The 5 entries are based on the number of rows that contain “CDKN1A”, and of those 5 rows, 2 contain the term “PANDAR” (as shown in Figure 4.2 A, dashed box). If we reverse the search terms, and place “PANDAR” in the HGNC Filter and “CDKN1A” in the Search Box, we receive the same two rows, but we now see this is the result of filtering based on only 4 entries (as shown in Figure 4.2B, dashed box). This is because there are 4 total rows in the entire dataset that contain the term “PANDAR”, of which 2 rows also contain the term “CDKN1A”. Understanding these seemingly small differences in filtering methods will help end users better understand how to use the data filtering tools to best refine their hypotheses. Figure 4.2: Data Filters versus the Search Box, Example 2 Another key difference between the HGNC Filter and the Search Box is the speed of filtering based on computational efficiency. Filtering via the HGNC filter box (on the left panel) is considerably quicker, so this should be the first choice for faster querying. Gene symbol information is found in three columns of the Main Data table (hgnc_intersection, downstream_hgnc, upstream_hgnc). It is important to understand how these columns differ from each other. The “hgnc_intersection” column denotes whether the p53motif location falls within an HGNC-named gene (Figure 4.3 A). The upstream_hgnc and downstream_hgnc columns denote the nearest upstream (5’) or downstream (3’) transcriptional start site (TSS) of an HGNC-named gene. For example, the p53 motif location depicted in Figure 4.3A would yield Gene X as the upstream_hgnc result and Gene Y as the downstream_hgnc result. Figure 4.3 C shows a more complicated example. In this case, Gene Y would be the result in both the hgnc_intersection and upstream_hgnc columns, since the TSS of Gene Y is the closest TSS to this p53RE. On the contrary, Gene X would be found in the upstream_gene column and Gene Y would be the downstream_hgnc result for the p53RE, as depicted in Figure 4.3D. Figure 4.3: How to interpret distance of a p53RE to the nearest HGNC Gene Location 4.1.2 Genomic coordinate filtering by chromosome and location The next three filters allow users to filter p53RE (rows) by chromosome and position. Users can restrict the data displayed to a single chromosome using the dropdown box. Chromosomes are listed in numerical order (from 1-22) and then by chrX, Y, and M. Users can also filter p53RE by their position on a chromosome using the Chromosome Start and Chromosome Stop input boxes. Entering a number in the Chromosome Start box will filter rows where the p53RE is found 3’ (higher number) of the value input. Entering a number in the Chromosome Stop box will restrict the data to p53RE that are found 5’ (lower number) to the input value. For example, selecting chr19 and restricting the Chromosome Start and Stop to 500000 and 550000, respectively, (solid box, Figure 4.4) will find 6 entries (dashed box, Figure 4.4). This functionality is similar to using common genome browsers (like UCSC) and restricting the “view” to chr19:500000-550000. Note that any numbers input into the Chromosome Start or Chromosome Stop boxes must be free of any commas or other delimiters. Figure 4.4: Filtering p53RE by chromosome location and position 4.2 p53 Binding Filters This filtering panel allows for users to select p53RE with observed, in vivo p53 occupancy defined in a series of 4 different meta-analyses.

D1, pp. D316–D325, Jan. 2022, doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab996. The first dropdown box allows users to filter based on whether the p53RE was bound by p53 in at least one of the 4 meta-analyses (Figure 4.5). This represents the least stringent p53 binding filter because it allows that the occupancy was observed in a single experiment. Selecting NO will display p53RE without p53 binding in these studies, while selecting ANY will display all p53RE (rows) that pass all other filters. When users first start the p53motifDB, the default filtering scheme is to only display p53RE (rows) that have at least one observation of p53 binding across the 4 meta-analyses. The remaining 4 dropdown boxes limit the filtering to individual p53 binding meta-analyses. In-depth, specific information on the underlying meta-analyses data can best be found in the specific manuscripts listed above. Users can export some of this information from Riege et al and the ReMap 2022 analysis, including specific cell lines and conditions where p53 binding was observed. in the “Query Other Datasets” Chapter 6). Figure 4.5: Filtering p53RE by p53 protein occupancy 4.3 Chromatin Filters The second group of filters allows users to select p53RE that fall within genomic regions that have characteristics of putative transcriptional regulatory regions. The ENCODE Project identified genomic regions with defined chromatin structure characteristics. The goal was to segment the genome into functional regions, such as regions that are likely to be enhancers or promoters or regions that are likely to be heterochromatin. The p53motifBD surveyed p53RE locations relative to these chromatin-based functional genome segmentations. Below, we describe the three types of segmentation and how users can filter p53RE based on these characteristics. 4.3.1 Candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCRE) The first filter allows users to select p53RE that overlap candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements (cCRE). These elements were defined by integrating DNase and ATAC accessibility information, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac enrichment, and binding by CTCF or other transcription factors. Figure 4.6: Filtering by candidate Cis-Regulatory Element (cCRE) The top dropdown box (shown in Figure 4.6 allows users to filter by whether or not the p53RE is found within a defined cCRE (YES/NO) or can choose ANY to ignore cCRE as a discriminating factor. By default, the “ANY” filter is applied, meaning that cCRE is not used as a filtering criterion. The box below (“Filter by cCRE Type”) allows users to select specific types of cCRE and filter only on those by selecting terms (Described in Table 1) in the box below. TABLE 1 Abbreviation Description CA-CTCF chromatin accessible and bound by CTCF CA chromatin accessible without other chromatin-based features CA-H3K4me3 chromatin accessible and enriched for H3K4me3 CA-TF chromatin accessible and bound by some transcription factors dELS distal enhancer-like signature pELS proximal enhancer-like signature PLS promoter-like signature TF bound by some transcription factors without other chromatin-based features More information on the process by which cCRE regions were defined, please see the SCREEN website from the Weng lab at UMass Med.

Moore et al., “Expanded encyclopaedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes,” Nature, vol. 583, no. 7818, pp. 699–710, Jul. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2493-4. 4.3.2 DNAse Hypersensitive Sites (DHS) The second filter is for p53RE that are located within DNAse-Hypersensitive Sites (DHS) (box 3 in Figure 4.7). The ENCODE Project cataloged hundreds of thousands of regions of the genome, across hundreds of cells, tissues and conditions, that are accessible to DNAse and presumably would also be accessible to transcription factors, transcriptional machinery, and other DNA binding proteins (other than nucleosomes). Extensive analysis suggests these regions may be transcriptional regulatory elements, like enhancers, promoters, insulators, and silencers. Users can filter p53RE based on the presence within DHS regions using the Basic Filters on the left panel (Figure 4.7), box 3), and can export additional information about these locations, including the cell type where the DHS was observed and cell type-specific scores, using methods described in Chapter 6: Querying Additional Datasets. Figure 4.7: Filtering by chromHMM type 4.3.3 chromHMM The final set of filters is for p53RE located within chromHMM-based genome segments. This is shown in the bottom two input boxes in Figure 4.7. chromHMM is a mathematical model that incorporates multiple forms of chromatin and transcriptional data to define the most likely “functional state” of that genomic location. For example, regions with high enrichment for H3K27ac, low levels of H3K4me3, and that are accessible to DNAse likely represent transcriptional enhancers. We incorporated the “fullstack” chromHMM dataset which defines genomic locations based on their most common functional classification across multiple cell types. Thus, users can select p53RE that are located in transcriptional enhancers, open chromatin regions, promoters, heterochromatin/transcriptionall repressed areas of the genome, and many other types of locations. To do this, users can select either detailed chromHMM terms or summary chromHMM groups from the respective dropdown menus shown in Figure 4.7. A description of each annotation type can be found in the table below, but complete information on how each chromHMM can be found in [1], or at the Ernst Lab GitHub page.

Vu and J. Ernst, “Universal annotation of the human genome through integration of over a thousand epigenomic datasets,” Genome Biology, vol. 23, no. 1, p. 9, Jan. 2022, doi: 10.1186/s13059-021-02572-z. 4.4 3D Genome Information Figure 4.8: Filtering by p53RE location within 3D chromatin loops The p53motifDB provides p53RE information integrated with four separate 3D chromatin data sets. The concept is to identify p53RE that participate in long-distance chromatin interactions, the type normally found between distal regulatory elements and gene promoters. Although the terminology can differ between assays, generally 3D chromatin data entry contains two genomic locations: a bait and an prey. The bait is the genomic location of interest to which you are hoping to find interactions with distal elements. These can also be called “anchors” or “viewpoints”. This is most evident in promoter capture-style experiments, where the bait/anchor/viewpoint is a promoter region. The concept is to then identify distal elements nearby the promoter in physical, 3D space in the nucleus, as proximity is thought to reflect biochemical function (such as an enhancer element interacting with a promoter to activate transcription). Consistent with the p53RE-centric data analysis in this database, the p53RE can be found in either the bait or prey region. As shown in Figure 4.8, the four dropdown boxes allow users to filter by the presence of a p53RE within a bait/prey interaction. Users can select YES if they only want to consider p53RE that are part of such interactions, NO if they would like to examine those with no known 3D interactions, or ANY if this is not a concern for their analysis. Importantly, users can gain additional information about the bait:prey relationships, including the location of both, cell line information, and other descriptive or quantitative information as described in Chapter 6 The following datasets are provided in the p53motifDB: TABLE 3 dataset citation GeneHancer S.

We only considered variation within the p53RE itself, as described in the accompanying manuscript. Using the dropdown menus, users can select whether or not the p53RE has a known variant (YES/NO), or whether sequence variation is not important to the filtering (EITHER). Additional information about genomic variation within the p53RE, including the variant, predicted effects, and other key information, can be obtained by downloading accessory datasets as explained in Chapter 6: Querying Additional Datasets 4.6 Other Genomic Variables The final set of Basic Filters represent miscellaneous genomic features that may be of interest to users of the p53motifDB. Each filter provides basic functionality, asking users to choose whether or not to filter based on the feature (YES/NO), or whether the feature is not important for their analysis and shouldn’t be considered (ANY). “ANY” is selected by default. 4.6.1 Intergenic or Intragenic? This filter allows users to select whether their p53RE are located within gene bodies (intragenic) or outside of gene bodies (intergenic). By default, “ANY” is selected which means p53RE are displayed regardless of their location relative to genes. Gene models and locations were taken from the Ensembl v.111 release for hg38 reference genome. 4.6.2 Repetitive Elements Genomes contain multiple types of repetitive DNA sequences, including simple DNA repeats, microsatellites, and viral and transposable-element derived sources. Multiple publications have noted that p53RE can be found within these types of repetitive elements, and that p53 can regulate transcription and other genomic activities via binding to such repetitive elements. We surveyed p53RE locations within repetitive genomic elements using the RepeatMasker dataset hosted by the UCSC Genome Browser. Additional information about the repetitive elements, such as the type of element, can be obtained by downloading accessory data sets as explained in Chapter 6: Querying Additional Datasets 4.6.3 ENCODE BlackList Genomic approaches, like ChIP-seq, require alignment to a reference genome. The Blacklist has been compiled containing regions of the human hg38 reference genome that are recurrently identified across multiple assays and for multiple antibodies/targets, suggesting anomalies in genome assembly. This information, along with the methods and rationale for selection of blacklists, can be found in a recent publication from the Boyle and Kundaje labs [1]. Thus, these regions are traditionally filtered from downstream analysis. Users can filter their p53RE by their location within (YES) or outside of (NO) blacklist regions. If these regions are not important for downstream analysis, users can ignore this filtering step and select ANY, which is the default setting. We strongly advise that users select NO on the Blacklist filter and only consider p53RE for which genomic assay data can be reliably mapped and reported (not in the blacklist regions). The current ENCODE Blacklist for hg38 can found at the Boyle Lab GitHub Page. [1] H. M. Amemiya, A. Kundaje, and A. P. Boyle, “The ENCODE Blacklist: Identification of Problematic Regions of the Genome,” Sci Rep, vol. 9, no. 1, p. 9354, Jun. 2019, doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-45839-z. 4.6.4 Potential CG Methylation Sites Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation in the CG context can influence p53 interactions with the genome in interesting ways. The influence of CG methylation depends on the position of the CG within the p53RE. Users can select whether the p53RE contains a potential site of CG methylation. Selecting YES does not mean the p53RE contains experimentally-determined DNA methylation, rather that a CG is present as a potential target of methylation. [1] J. F. Kribelbauer et al., “Quantitative Analysis of the DNA Methylation Sensitivity of Transcription Factor Complexes,” Cell Reports, vol. 19, no. 11, pp. 2383–2395, Jun. 2017, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.069.

The two buttons below the Main Data Table allow users to select which columns to export and then to save their data to a local file (column separated value, .csv file). We recommend ALWAYS performing some sort of basic filtering before exporting your dataset. Users who would like the full, unfiltered Main Data Table can find this at our Zenodo repository. Figure 5.1: Buttons for exporting the currently displayed Main Data Table 5.1 Select Columns to Export Button The “Select Columns to Export” botton brings up a dialog box (Figure 5.1A) where users can manually select which columns of the data table are to be exported. If no columns are selected, ALL data is exported by default. We strongly recommend exporting ALL data columns and selecting/filtering further in other data analysis programs, but this function is provided as a convenience. Figure 5.2: Any or all Main Data Columns can be selected for export 5.2 Download Filtered Data Button The “Download filtered data” button (Figure 5.1B) will trigger a “Save As” dialog box, prompting the user to name and save their comma separated value (.csv) file containing their exported data. The data exported will depend on whether the user has selected any columns using the “Select Columns to Export” button (5.1A) and based on the number of entries in the Data Table (5.1C). The number of entries that will be exported will depend on Basic Filtering (covered in Chapter 4 and if the Search Box is used (also covered in Chapter4. As an example, if users selected the “Download filtered data” button based on Figure 5.1A, 15,848 rows/entries would be exported.

Chapter 5 describes how to export the Main Data Table information, and this chapter describes how users can download a series of “accessory” datasets that provide additional information about the p53RE in that filtered Main Data Table. Each button allows users to export new information about their p53RE. This works much like cross-referencing in sql or other relational database schemes. Once the Main Data Table filters are applied, users can export accessory data using the buttons at the bottom of the App (shown in Figure 3.1). Data are exported as comma separated value (.csv) files via a system dialog box where files can be named and saved to the location of the users choice. Data are exported for ALL p53RE found in the filtered Main Data Table, even if there are no records for the particular accessory data. If there are no records, the p53RE unique_id (chromosome number, start location, and stop location) is displayed, but other columns will display “NA”. We recommend applying multiple Basic Filters before exporting accessory data. Users interested in all information contained in the accessory data tables can find these on our Zenodo repository, which also contains a pre-compiled sqlite database for use of advanced query language. In the next subsections, we will go through the types of data that users can export from these accessory tables. 6.1 ClinVar column_name information unique_id chromosome_start_stop for p53RE clinVar_chrom chromosome where the clinVar variant is located clinVar_start start of chromosome position of the clinVar variant clinVar_stop stop/end of chromosome position of the clinVar variant clinVar_id clinVar database standard ID clinVar_ref the reference allele clinVar_alt the alternate allele clinVar_type the type of clinVar variant; options include INSERTION, DELETION, SNV, MNV 6.2 dbSNP Single p53RE locations may contain multiple genomic variants in the dbSNP accessory dataset, so the same p53RE unique_id (location) can be found in multiple rows of the exported data.
